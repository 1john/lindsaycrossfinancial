                            <p>Hello, I'm Jeremiah Cross, an independent insurance professional helping individuals and families make confident, informed decisions about their healthcare and financial futures.</p>
                            <p>I hold a degree in Economics from Arizona State University, which shapes how I approach insurance: analytically, transparently, and with a strong focus on long-term outcomes. I work primarily with Medicare and life insurance, helping clients understand their options without pressure or confusion.</p>
                            <p>I proudly serve the Chicagoland area as well as Central Illinois, working with clients both in person and remotely to make the process as convenient as possible.</p>

                        <div class="bio-content">
                            <p>I was born and raised in Central Florida and completed my education at Eastern Illinois University before ultimately settling in Chicago. Along the way, I built a strong background in sales and client-focused roles, where I learned the importance of listening, clear communication, and earning trust.</p>
                            <p>I entered the Medicare and insurance field to help people navigate complex choices with confidence. Medicare isn't one-size-fits-all, and my approach is simple: provide clear education, honest guidance, and personalized support – without pressure.</p>
                            <p>My goal is to help clients understand their options and choose coverage that truly fits their needs, while being a dependable resource they can rely on year after year.</p>
