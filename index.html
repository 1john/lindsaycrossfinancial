                                <p>Hello, I'm Jeremiah Cross, an independent insurance professional helping individuals and families make confident, informed decisions about their healthcare and financial futures.</p>
                                <p>I hold a degree in Economics from Arizona State University, which shapes how I approach insurance: analytically, transparently, and with a strong focus on long-term outcomes. I work primarily with Medicare and life insurance, helping clients understand their options without pressure or confusion.</p>
                                <p>I proudly serve the Chicagoland area as well as Central Illinois, working with clients both in person and remotely to make the process as convenient as possible.</p>

                                <p>I was born and raised in Central Florida and completed my education at Eastern Illinois University before ultimately settling in Chicago. Along the way, I built a strong background in sales and client-focused roles, where I learned the importance of listening, clear communication, and earning trust.</p>
                                <p>I entered the Medicare and insurance field to help people navigate complex choices with confidence. Medicare isn't one-size-fits-all, and my approach is simple: provide clear education, honest guidance, and personalized support – without pressure.</p>
                                <p>My goal is to help clients understand their options and choose coverage that truly fits their needs, while being a dependable resource they can rely on year after year.</p>

                            <p>Creditable coverage is prescription drug coverage (for example, from an employer, union, TRICARE, Indian Health Service, or the Department of Veterans Affairs) that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug coverage. Consumers with creditable coverage when they become eligible for Medicare can generally keep that coverage without paying a penalty if they decide to enroll in Medicare prescription drug coverage later.</p>
                            <p>The organization providing the prescription drug coverage must inform the consumer annually (generally in a letter or organization newsletter) if the prescription drug coverage is creditable coverage. The consumer will need this information if they later enroll in a Medicare Plan that provides Part D prescription drug coverage.</p>

                            <p>If a consumer does not enroll in Part D coverage when they are first eligible, or if they have a break in Part D coverage of 63 consecutive days or longer, they may be subject to a Part D late enrollment penalty (LEP). The Part D LEP is required by law and will be calculated by CMS and added to the consumer's monthly Part D premium for as long as they are enrolled Part D coverage, even if the consumer enrolls in a $0 premium plan. To help ensure a positive consumer experience, it is important that consumers understand what the LEP is and that it will apply regardless of which carrier or plan the consumer chooses.</p>
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> The LEP may be reduced or eliminated if the consumer qualifies for the Low-Income Subsidy Program (i.e., Extra Help).</p>
